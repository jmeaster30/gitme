# gitme

My own git server repo manager thingy

## Ideas

- API (ruby)
  - This will be a rest api that handles authentication and has routes to CRUD repositories, branches, issues etc. etc.
  - configure API to sync with other git server providers (like github)
- CLI (clojure)
  - This is a CLI client that just calls the api endpoints
- WEB
  - web interface to have a nice UI for the API
  - I need cool graphs
  - language
    - ReactJS meh I have used it before
    - Svelte neat
    - Elm neat and(but) functional
